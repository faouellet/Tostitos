* MinChip16 virtual machine *
*****************************

MinChip16 is a minimalist version of the Chip16 architecture developped for the Tostitos operating system.
The text below reproduce the relevant parts of the official Chip16 specifications.
For informations about the Chip16 architecture, go to https://github.com/chip16/chip16.

File Format:
-----------

ROMs are stored either in a Chip16 ROM file (.c16), or a raw binary file (preferred .bin, also .c16).
The ROM file stores a 16-byte header, and the binary data after that.
Emulators should load ROM headers for internal use, and only use the binary data for emulation.
Binary data is always loaded at address 0x0000.

The header is as follows (0x00 - 0x0F) :
- 0x00: Magic number 'CH16'
- 0x04: Reserved
- 0x05: Spec version (high nibble=major, low nibble=minor, so 0.7 = 0x07 and 1.0 = 0x10)
- 0x06: Rom size (excl. header, in bytes)
- 0x0A: Start address (initial value of PC)
- 0x0C: CRC32 checksum (excl. header, polynom = 0x04c11db7)

- 0x10: Start of Chip16 raw rom, end of header

CPU:
-----

1x 16 bit program counter (PC)
1x 16 bit stack pointer (SP)
16x 16 bit general purpose registers (R0 - RF)
1x 8 bit flag register

Machine uses little-endian byte ordering.

All opcodes take exactly 1 cycle to execute.
CPU speed is 1 Mhz.

Memory:
--------
64 KB (65536 bytes).

0x0000 - Start of ROM.
0xFDF0 - Start of stack (512 bytes).
0xFFF0 - IO ports.

Flag register:
---------------
Bit[0] - Reserved
Bit[1] - c (Unsigned Carry and Unsigned Borrow flag)
Bit[2] - z (Zero flag)
Bit[3] - Reserved
Bit[4] - Reserved
Bit[5] - Reserved
Bit[6] - o (Signed Overflow Flag)
Bit[7] - n (Negative Flag; aka Sign Flag)

c flag:
- for add - is set when the result would have imaginary bit[16] set, else its cleared.
- for sub - is set when the operation needed to borrow from bit[16], else its cleared.
- for mul - is set when the result is too big to fit into 16 bits, else its cleared.
- for div - is set when the remainder of the division is non-zero, else it is cleared.

z flag:
- is set when the result is 0, else its cleared.

o flag:
- in general this flag is used when the sign of the result differs from what would be expected.
- for addition it is set when the result is positive and both operands were negative,
or if the result is negative and both operands were positive; else it is cleared.
- for subtraction (x-y=z) it is set when z is positive and x is negative and y is positive,
or if z is negative and x is positive and y is negative; else it is cleared.

n flag:
- it is set when the result is less than 0 (bit[15] == 1); else it is cleared.

Conditional Types:
---------------
The conditions below are used for conditional jumps and conditional calls.
For example: "jle some_label" or "cno some_label"
The condition in brackets refer to the Flag register's flags.

Z   = 0x0 // [z==1]         Equal (Zero)
NZ  = 0x1 // [z==0]         Not Equal (Non-Zero)
N   = 0x2 // [n==1]         Negative
NN  = 0x3 // [n==0]         Not-Negative (Positive or Zero)
P   = 0x4 // [n==0 && z==0] Positive
O   = 0x5 // [o==1]         Overflow
NO  = 0x6 // [o==0]         No Overflow
A   = 0x7 // [c==0 && z==0] Above       (Unsigned Greater Than)
AE  = 0x8 // [c==0]         Above Equal (Unsigned Greater Than or Equal)
B   = 0x9 // [c==1]         Below       (Unsigned Less Than)
BE  = 0xA // [c==1 || z==1] Below Equal (Unsigned Less Than or Equal)
G   = 0xB // [o==n && z==0] Signed Greater Than
GE  = 0xC // [o==n]         Signed Greater Than or Equal
L   = 0xD // [o!=n]         Signed Less Than
LE  = 0xE // [o!=n || z==1] Signed Less Than or Equal
RES = 0xF // Reserved for future use

Alternative Valid Mnemonics:
C   = 0x9 // [c==1]         Carry     (Same as B)
NC  = 0x8 // [c==0]         Not Carry (Same as GE)

Opcodes:
---------

HH - high byte.
LL - low byte.
N - nibble (4 bit value).
X, Y, Z - 4 bit register identifier.
